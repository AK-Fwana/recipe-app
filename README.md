# Recipe App

## Description

The Recipe App is a React-based application that lets users browse and view recipes with various dietary labels and health information. 
Developed as part of a course with Winc Academy, this project provides an opportunity to practice React fundamentals while working with 
real-world data from a recipe API (Edamam). The app supports searching and filtering recipes based on dietary needs, ensuring users can 
quickly find recipes suited to their preferences or dietary restrictions.

This app includes:

- A main page displaying a list of recipes
- A detailed page for each recipe, showing comprehensive recipe information

The project is styled with ChakraUI for ease of design and responsiveness. 
The starter files include sample data, which can be explored and customized as you build your app.
