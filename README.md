# üç≤ Recipe Finder App

A **React-based recipe search app** that allows users to explore delicious recipes tailored to various dietary needs and health preferences. 
Created as part of a course project for **Winc Academy**, this app provides an interactive platform for users to search for recipes, 
view detailed information, and accommodate dietary restrictions effortlessly. Whether you‚Äôre vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, or just curious, 
find the perfect recipe here!

## üåü Project Description

The **Recipe Finder App** is designed to help our Winc restaurant staff easily browse and offer meals that align with diverse dietary needs. 
By searching through recipes filtered by diet, health labels, or names, we ensure our team can quickly find suitable meals for customers, 
reducing the risk of serving dishes that may conflict with dietary restrictions or allergies.

- **Recipe Overview and Detail Pages**: Browse a list of recipes with an overview of essential details and click to view an in-depth recipe page.
- **Responsive and Stylish UI**: Built with Chakra UI for a responsive and accessible design.
  
This project provides an excellent learning opportunity for managing state in React, building dynamic interfaces, and fetching and handling data 
in real-time applications.
