# Recipe App

## Description

The Recipe App is a React-based application that lets users browse and view recipes with various dietary labels and health information. 
Developed as part of a course with Winc Academy, this project provides an opportunity to practice React fundamentals while working with 
real-world data from a recipe API (Edamam). The app supports searching and filtering recipes based on dietary needs, ensuring users can 
quickly find recipes suited to their preferences or dietary restrictions.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create interactive UI components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server that optimizes development experience for modern JavaScript frameworks.
- **ChakraUI**: A React component library that provides a simple, modular, and accessible component structure for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language used, leveraging modern JavaScript features.
- **JSON Server**: A lightweight server to simulate a REST API for serving data to the application.
- **Edamam API**: Used as the source for recipe data, including dietary and health information.
- **CSS3**: Used alongside ChakraUI for custom styling and layout adjustments.


This app includes:

- A main page displaying a list of recipes
- A detailed page for each recipe, showing comprehensive recipe information

The project is styled with ChakraUI for ease of design and responsiveness.
